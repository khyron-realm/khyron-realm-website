# Mines

Mines are randomly generated with different sizes and resources distributions.

Due to Khyron seismic activity, robots are forced to excavate a certain time inside the mine, before they get destroyed by the environment.

The mining time is usually between 3 and 5 minutes.

#### Environment:

* Big empty holes
* Explosive blocks
* Hidden Lava in blocks

#### Mine classes:

| Class | Size   |
|-------|--------|
| A     | 5 x 4  |
| B     | 6 x 5  |
| C     | 7 x 5  |
| D     | 8 x 6  |
| E     | 9 x 6  |
| F     | 10 x 7 |

#### Mine types:

| Type | Composition                            |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| S    | 80% Silicon                            |
| L    | 80% Lithium                            |
| T    | 80% Titanium                           |
| N    | 33% lithium, 33% silicon, 33% titanium |

#### Rarity:

* low
* medium
* high

#### Power-ups: 

Hidden chests in the mine are located behind the blocks and the user has to double-tap to collect them.

#### Default mine: 

Have a default mine that generates a few resources every 24h.
