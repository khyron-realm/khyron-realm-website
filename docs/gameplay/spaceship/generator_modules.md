Converts lithium into usable energy using special high-temperature processing that extracts all the electrons from its atoms.

### Titanium Converter

<!-- [Titanium Converter image] -->

Converts titanium into usable energy using special high-temperature processing that extracts all the electrons from its atoms.

### Power plant

<!-- [Power plant image] -->

Using nuclear fusion to smash atoms together, the power plant can create energy constantly. When the energy generation capacity is full, it needs to be manually collected to be added to the Energy Wall and keep the production constant.
