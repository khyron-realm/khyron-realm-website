# Beginning

The year is 2422. Technology advanced on Earth and our supplies demand is increasing. The world is still in peace and we are more united than ever.

There are now 400 years since we sent our ships to other planets. Our researchers discovered the closest class M planet, Khyron. It has Earth-like conditions that can sustain life. Arriving at this planet proves that we can finally become a multi planetary species.

The planet has some challenges when compared to Earth. Our improved technology allows us to make it habitable for humans. We sent a lot of AI-powered ships to make sure that the planet is ready for our arrival. We need the robots to build all the necessary buildings for humans to survive. And also to check if there are things that can be a threat for us.

The journey is long, very long. Too long for a human. It will take us 4 human generations to get the first person to touch the surface. This was what we knew back then when we sent the fleets. With the current technology, we built the most powerful engine and the biggest starship that can host humans up to 5 years. But this is not all. If you remember the first picture of a black hole, that was a breakthrough discovery. It lead us to use them as travelling shortcuts. The result? The journey now is as low as 4 years. Impressive … this is totally achievable. Let’s hope that our robots will do their mission and send us a good news message.

The planet looks beautiful, like a twin sister of our planet.

Khyron is situated in Betelgeuse solar system, Orion constellation. The gravity will make us a little heavy, so we need to have a better physical condition. The year will be a little longer. The temperature is almost like ours and we don’t need special gear to survive. We have almost all the necessary elements to survive which improves the chances. The weather. Well … we don’t know, hopefully will be good.

The main problem will be the earthquakes. Our ships are specially designed to resist up to 10 degrees on the Richter scale. But the good part is that we think that the natural resources regeneration is extremely fast. Which is good news.
