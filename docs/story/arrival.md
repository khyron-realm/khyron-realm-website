# Arrival

We sent two types of ships there. The first is the **Mothership**, which will hold as the meeting place for all the fleets, and multiple **Starships**, which are organised in fleets to communicate better with each other.
Starship and Megaship are two-stage ships that were made to travel to planets far away from us. The construction was possible with the rise of the rocket companies and the investments from people that believed it is possible.

The first stage is the **Interplanetary Booster**, which is capable of lifting from the Earth, surpassing the orbit and travelling as far as our Galaxy. **Spaceship** is the second stage. After the first stage does the hard job of leaving our galaxy, the second stage continues the journey to its destination. It is capable of carrying humans or a custom payload to have the supplies ready when we arrive on Khyron.

On the way to their target, our fleets were hit by a solar storm that damaged the electronic components. Luckily, we were attracted by Khyran gravitational field and will safely crash on it in a few weeks. Before this unfortunate event, we selected the trajectories for each ship to land in a given place. With a little hope, they will arrive without critical damage from the tough landing.
