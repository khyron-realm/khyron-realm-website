Collaboration increases the chances of building the equipments on the planet in the designated timeframe.
You will be on the **Spaceship**, your home base. The self assessment of the core modules has passed. They are 100% functional and will be enough to get you started.

After you get used with the equipment, you need to go outside to explore the planet. The core module of the ship has a built in map where you’ll see the location of the mothership on a central island. The planet has many mountain ranges. Each one has a mine rich with minerals. Silicon is the most common material, Lithium is less common and Titanium is the rarest. All of them are needed for rebuilding.
Going into the **mothership**, you can meet and collaborate with others. It is organised in multiple spaces where users can find different marketplaces and job sites. Energy is the most needed resource and will be used as a trading coin. You can purchase the exploitation rights for mines, parts of the ship, robot upgrades and others.

You will need to pay with energy. Why is that? Why do we need to pay for something new that isn’t ours? Similar to how the government works on Earth, the Mothership will act as the central governance to ensure the fairness and order. We need to act as a group, not as an individual.
