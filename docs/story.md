# Story

## Beginning

The year is 2422. There are now 400 years since we tried to get to another planets. From our research, we discovered the closest class M planet, Khyron, named after the person that discovered it. It has Earth-like conditions and can sustain life.

### Khyron realm

On the way to their target, our AI-powered fleets were hit by a solar storm that damaged the electronic components. Luckily, we will be attracted by Khyran gravitational field and we will safely crash on it in a few weeks. Before this unfortunate event, we selected the trajectories for each starship to land in a given place. Hopefully they will all arrive without critical damage from the tough landing.

___

## Arrival

Your mission is to rebuild the starship and start the exploration program on Khyron. Extract minerals from its rich mountains and rebuild all the damaged equipment. Try to find and collaborate with other colonists.

___

## Supplies

To avoid battles, the fleets agreed to host auctions to mine different portions of the planet.
